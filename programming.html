						<p>
							Since a bit over a year, every very once in a while my brother would teach me a bit of Python. Eventually, we started making a small game, he did basically all of it as I watched though, since I didn't know how to do anything yet. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Later on we also made a simple dictonary program which we later turned into a website with Flask. That was when my brother also taught me some HTML and CSS. With that project I started understanding programming more. Doing all the homework for this course also helped a lot. I tried to make all of those programs more robust and more complicated to get more practice out of them.
						</p>
						<p>
							I really want to do more programming in the future. I definitely want to make another game.

						I live at home with my mom, dad and older brother. They immigrated here from Bulgaria a few years before I was born. We live in a small house on a pretty quiet street. It's really nice to sit outside and do work whenever the weather is nice. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Back before the pandemic, my family and I would try to travel more often and do fun things. None of our other family lives in Canada so we would try to go visit all of them in Bulgaria whenever we could, usually every other year for about a month. We would also go to Cuba a lot since it's warm and the beaches are nice. Usually, we go there for a week or two. Sometimes we go to other places, but those trips are usually over a weekend, lik ethe time we went to New York.

						In elementary school I went to Clairlea P.S for 3 years. It was pretty close to my house, so when my grandma would come and visit for a few months she would walk me to school every day. I don't remember much, but I do remember getting into trouble (Nothing major xD).
					</p>
					<p>
						In grade 4 I switched schools and started going to Selwyn E.S. It was a much smaller school and quite a bit farther from my house. I went there because of the gifted program and had a good 2 years there. I didn't really want to continue the gifted program after that though and thought it would be fun to learn French, so that's what I did.
					</p>
					<p>
						I went to Cosburn M.S since they had an Intensive Extended French program. It was quite interesting and fun to learn a new language, but it was also quite difficult since almost all of our other classes were in French as well. I didn't do very well with it in grade 6, but I started getting the hang of it more in grade 7.

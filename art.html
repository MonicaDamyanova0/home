				<p>
					Drawing is the hobby I do the most and the thing that I'm best at. I draw basically everyday even if it's just a few small doodles. Typically, I do more digital art now, but I used to do a lot more traditional art. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been drawing since I was very little, since I could really remember. I remember people telling me I was really good as a small child and I just kept doing it because of that encouragement and because it was fun. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I remember drawing a lot in elementary school and bringing my drawing to class to show them to my friends. I got more into it in grade 4 and 5 since I got a new sketchbook and graphic pencils and I would bring those to school a lot. My brother gave me his old laptop and he also gave me a pen tablet for Christmas. I used it for digital art and I would draw a lot on GIMP and then Photoshop. I got a new tablet later on, I installed drawing apps on it and started using it more for digital art, since I could take it anywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, I got an iPad and bought Procreate for it. Because of that, I don't really use my computer to draw anymore, it's a lot easier for me to draw on my iPad and since I can bring it anywhere I use it a lot more.

					<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
					<p>
						Along with drawing, I've also tried some 3D modeling. I learned how to do it during the summer of 2020. I made a few different models which was a lot of fun, yet kind of challenging. There are lots of parts to 3D modeling you need to learn like the actual modeling bit, rigging, making textures, etc. Because of that, it can take quite a while to finish a model. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						I don't model much anymore since it takes quite a while to do and I just haven't really gotten around to it yet.

							Here is the model I made last summer. It's rigged and I even tried to add in some particles for the fur. I want to remake it and do it better.

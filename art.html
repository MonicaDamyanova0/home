				<p>
					Drawing is the hobby I do the most and the thing that I'm best at. I draw basically everyday even if it's just a few small doodles. Typically, I do more digital art now, but I used to do a lot more traditional art. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been drawing since I was very little, since I could really remember. I remember people telling me I was really good as a young kid and I just kept doing it because of that encouragement and the enjoyment I got out of it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I remember drawing a lot in elementary school and bringing my drawings to class to show them to my friends. I got more into it in grade 4 and 5 since I got a new sketchbook and graphic pencils and I would bring those to school a lot. My brother gave me his old laptop and he also gave me a pen tablet for Christmas. I used it for digital art and I would draw a lot on GIMP and then Photoshop. I got a new tablet later on, I installed drawing apps on it and started using it more for digital art rather than my computer, since I could take it anywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, I got an iPad and bought Procreate for it. Because of that, I don't really use my computer to draw anymore, it's a lot easier and more fun for me to draw on my iPad.

					<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
					<p>
						Along with drawing, I've also tried some 3D modeling. I learned and did the most modeling last year during quarantine, when I had the free time to do so. I made a few different models which was a lot of fun, yet kind of challenging. There are lots of parts to 3D modeling you need to learn like the actual modeling bit, rigging, making textures, etc. Because of that, it can take quite a while to finish a model. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						I don't model much anymore since it takes quite a while to do and I just haven't really gotten around to it yet.

							Here is the model I made last summer over the course of a week. It's rigged and I even tried to add in some particles for the fur. I want to remake it and do it better though.

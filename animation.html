			<h1>Animation</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					I started animating some time around grade 5 when I was able to mess around with Photoshop. For a while I had wanted to learn how to animate and I had seen other people animating with Photoshop so I though I might as well try to. It was a fun experience and continued animating when I found the time to. When I got an iPad, I started to use it much more for animation since I could take it anywhere I wanted to.

			<h2>Video Editing</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Since animations would take a very long time to do entirely by hand, I thought it would be nice to learn how to use a video editing software ot be able to do some things quicker. I decided to learn DaVinci Resolve since it's free and looked pretty good. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I haven't made a lot with it yet, but I plan on doing more and have some more animations that I'm working on.

							This was a project I made for art a few weeks ago. I drew everything and did all the frame-by-frame animations in Procreate, then put it all together in DaVinci Resolve.
						</td>
						<td>
							This was an animation I finished in February for VAC. I made the rough animation in FlipaClip, lined, coloured and shaded it in Procreate and then put all the frames back into FlipaClip. It was a long and tedious process.

			<h1>Animation</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					I started animating some time around grade 5 when I was able to mess around with Photoshop. For a while I had wanted to learn how to animate and I had seen other people animating with Photoshop so I though I might as well try to. It was a fun experience and continued animating when I found the time to. I never really finished animating anything though. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When I got a tablet, I started to use it a lot more for animating and digital art in general much more. I would use the free version of FlipaClip and make short, little animations, nothing great though.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I got an iPad, I bought Procreate and the full version of FlipaClip. That's when I started to try and do more with animation. I would try to finish more animations and do ones which are more difficult. It's a lot of fun and I really want to do more in the future.

			<h2>Video Editing</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Since animations would take a very long time to do entirely by hand, I thought it would be nice to learn how to use a video editing software to be able to do some things quicker. I decided to learn how to use DaVinci Resolve since it's free and looked pretty good. It's pretty fun and easy to use. It's so easy to make videos look good with it and I kind of wish that I learned it sooner.
				</p>
				<p>
					I haven't made a lot with it yet, but I plan on doing more and have some more animations that I'm currently working on.

							This was a project I made for art a few weeks ago. I drew everything and did all the frame-by-frame animations in Procreate, then put it all together in DaVinci Resolve.
						</td>
						<td>
							This was an animation I finished in February for VAC. I made the rough animation in FlipaClip, then lined, coloured and shaded it in Procreate. Then put all the frames back into FlipaClip. It was a long and tedious process.

							Every once in a while my brother would teach me a bit of Python. We started making a small game, he did basically all of it as I watched, since I didn't know how to do anything yet. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Later on we also made a simple dictonary program which we later turned into a website with Flask. That was when my brother also taught me some HTML and CSS. With that project I started getting more of the hang of programming. Doing all the homework for this course also helped a lot. I tried to make all of those programs more robust and more complicated to get more practice out of them.
						</p>
						<p>
							I really want to do more programming in the future. I definitely want to make another game.

								This is what the dictionary website looks like so far. You can search for words, add words to the database and edit them.

			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Art</h2>
				<p>
					I've been drawing since I was very little, since I could really remember. It's probably the hobby I do the most and the thing that I'm best at. I draw basically everyday even if it's just a few small doodles. I typically do more digital art now since it's much quicker for me and I don't have to clean anything after. Sometimes I also do traditional art, but not as frequently as I used to. 
				</p>
				<h3>3D Modeling</h3>
				<p>
					Along with drawing, I've also tried some 3D modeling. I learned how to do it during the summer of 2020. I made a few different models which was a lot of fun, yet kind of challenging. There are lots of parts to 3D modeling you need to learn like the actual modeling bit, rigging, making textures, etc. I don't model much anymore since it takes quite a while to do and I just haven't really gotten around to it yet.

				<h2>Animation</h2>
				<p>
					I started animating some time around grade 5 when I was able to mess around with Photoshop. For a while I had wanted to learn how to animate and I had seen other people animating with Photoshop so I though I might as well try to. It was a fun experience and continued animating when I found the time to. I don't use Photoshop to animate anymore though, I use FlipaClip and Procreate.
				</p>
				<h3>Video Editing</h3>
				<p>
					For a long time I would soley use animation programs to make an finalize my animations which would take a while, so I thought if I were to use a video editing program, I could probably do it faster. So I downloaded DaVinci Resolve and started learning how to use it. I haven't made a lot with it yet, but I plan on doing more.

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				<p>
					Programming is a newer hobby of mine. I started about a year ago, but I wouldn't do it frequently enough to actually become good at it. It was this year when my brother and I made a simple dictionary program when I started getting the hang of it. Doing all the homework also helped a lot.

						<li>Watching shows on Netflix</li>
						<li>Playing video games like:
							<ul>
								<li>Minecraft</li>

						</li>
					</ul>
					I also like to sit outside and enjoy the weather, sometimes I go for walks or play on my trampoline.
